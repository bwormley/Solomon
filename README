The Solomon Server and Client

The Spring 2012 semester's CS151 class (Object Oriented Design) at San
Jose State University has approximately 15 teams of students designing
and developing a Rock-Paper-Scissors game to pit a human player
against an automated player with increasingly sophisticated
heuristics. At the end of the semester, there may be interest in
hosting a mini-tournament of the team projects. It would be
instructive and fun to have a means for the programs to play against
each other, without human intervention.

The Solomon Server serves as an arbiter, facilitator, and automator
between two disparate, remote instances of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game,
with no human involvement, to allow a large number of rounds to be
played in a relatively short amount of time.

The Solomon Client serves as an interface between a team’s RPS game
implementation and the Solomon Server, allowing any two teams’
implementations to play each other with a minimum of changes needed to
each team’s program.  The details of the connection, remote player
selection, rounds administration, match administration, shared
parameters negotiation, and protocol, are all transparent to the RPS.
